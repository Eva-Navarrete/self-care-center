# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

# My Process
- I started off with HTML document and researching tags and containers. I was really confused and still confused with creating tags and naming. but i started with that.
- I then went on the CSS file and started making the page look like the example given. I struggled a lot with placing the buttons and radio buttons in center. I used flex box to try and solve that issue.
-the javascript i thought would be easier since we had just done the paired project. I struggled with creating event listeners and referenced a page that was shared on out slack channel. and used to google to create a tag in the html through js and append the the messages array when button was clicked. I feel like this is a bit like cheating since it wasn't in our lessons.
-Overall I feel like I'm pretty behind with DOM manipulation. I understand that my code has a lot of issues. I struggled a lot through this process.
